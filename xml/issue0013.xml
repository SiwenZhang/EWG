Reviewed by EWG in Portland 2012, proceeding to CWG. The library part is <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2008/n2648.html">N2648 C++ Dynamic Arrays</a>, and that part is proceeding to LWG.
</p>
<p>
<p>Accepted into the Working Draft in Bristol 2013, as N3639.</p>
</p>
<p>
Moved in Chicago 2013 to be designated for an Array Extension TS, which hasn't
materialized yet.
