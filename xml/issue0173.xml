Discussed in Lenexa. Summary of straw polls:
</p>
<p>
Straw poll: Are you intrigued by a notion of delayed parameter evaluation?
</p>
<p>
SF: 6 F: 7 N: 2 A: 3 SA: 1
</p>
<p>
Straw poll: Annotation at the call site?
</p>
<p>
SF: 1 F: 0 N: 9 A: 0 SA: 7
</p>
<p>
Straw poll: Pass by lambda rather than evaluate on first use?
</p>
<p>
SF: 5 F: 4 N: 5 A: 0 SA: 3 
</p>
<p>
EWG expressed interest in the idea, but various people were very concerned
about the impact of such a facility, voicing caution that it is not just
syntactic sugar but rather something much more significant, and suggested
that a much more comprehensive analysis paper should be produced.
