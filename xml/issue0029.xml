<p>
Reviewed by EWG in Portland 2012, deemed to be handled by the Concepts Study Group (SG8).
</p>
<p>
Deemed post-C++14 material in Chicago 2013. SG8 isn't including it in their
scope for the near future. Voutilainen is planning to write a simplified
proposal for C++17.
</p>
<p>
Discussed in Lenexa. EWG encouraged the author to come back in Kona
with a more detailed proposal.
