Discussed in Lenexa. The design of generated comparison operators (see
<iref ref="116"/>) was 
clarified, there is no ignoring of members of certain type, but rather 
suppression of generation. The author of this paper withdrew his opposition 
to the direction of generated operators, and withdrew the proposal.
