See <a href="http://open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG21/docs/cwg_toc.html#1561">Core issue 1561</a>.
</p>
<p>Discussed in Rapperswil 2014. Daryle Walker has an unpublished paper aiming to solve this <a href="http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.github.com/CTMacUser/multiarray-iso-proposal/master/expanded-aggregate-proposal.html">here</a>. EWG suggests that Dos Reis works with Walker to get the paper on EWG's plate.</p>
<p>
N4404 was discussed in Lenexa, EWG rejected the paper as such and 
recommended looking at a more comprehensive approach.
