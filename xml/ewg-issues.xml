  <p>The purpose of this document is to record the status of issues
  which have come before the Evolution Working Group (EWG) of the INCITS PL22.16
  and ISO WG21 C++ Standards Committee. Issues represent
  potential defects in the ISO/IEC IS 14882:2003(E) document, 
  and proposed extensions to it.
  </p>

  <p>This document contains only evolution issues which are actively being
  considered by the Evolution Working Group, i.e., issues which have a
  status of <a href="ewg-active.html#New">New</a>, <a href="ewg-active.html#Open">Open</a>, 
  <a href="ewg-active.html#Ready">Ready</a>, or <a href="ewg-active.html#Review">Review</a>. See
  <a href="ewg-complete.html">Evolution Completed Issues List</a> for issues considered completed (adopted) and 
  <a href="ewg-closed.html">Evolution Closed Issues List</a> for issues considered closed (rejected).</p>

  <p>The issues in these lists are not necessarily formal ISO Defect
  Reports (DR's). While some issues will eventually be elevated to
  official Defect Report status, other issues will be disposed of in
  other ways. See <a href="#Status">Issue Status</a>.</p>

  <p>This document includes <i>[bracketed italicized notes]</i> as a
  reminder to the EWG of current progress on issues. Such notes are
  strictly unofficial and should be read with caution as they may be
  incomplete or incorrect. Be aware that EWG support for a particular
  resolution can quickly change if new viewpoints or killer examples are
  presented in subsequent discussions.</p>

  <p>For the most current official version of this document see

  Requests for further information about this document should include
  the document number above, reference ISO/IEC 14882:2003(E), and be
  submitted to Information Technology Industry Council (ITI), 1250 Eye
  Street NW, Washington, DC 20005.</p>

  </p>

<p><a name="submit_issue"></a><b>How to submit an issue</b></p>

<ol style="list-style-type:upper-alpha">
<li><a name="submit_issue_A"></a>
Mail your issue to the author of this list.
</li>
<li><a name="submit_issue_B"></a>
Specify a short descriptive title.  If you fail to do so, the subject line of your
mail will be used as the issue title.
</li>
<li><a name="submit_issue_C"></a>
If the "From" on your email is not the name you wish to appear as issue submitter,
then specify issue submitter.
</li>
<li><a name="submit_issue_D"></a>
Provide a brief discussion of the problem you wish to correct.  Refer to the latest
working draft or standard using [section.tag] and paragraph numbers where appropriate.
</li>
<li><a name="submit_issue_E"></a>
Provide proposed wording.  This should indicate exactly how you want the standard
to be changed.  General solution statements belong in the discussion area.  This
area contains very clear and specific directions on how to modify the current
draft.  If you are not sure how to word a solution, you may omit this part.
But your chances of a successful issue greatly increase if you attempt wording.
</li>
<li><a name="submit_issue_F"></a>
It is not necessary for you to use html markup.  However, if you want to, you can
&lt;ins&gt;<ins>insert text like this</ins>&lt;/ins&gt; and &lt;del&gt;<del>delete text like
this</del>&lt;/del&gt;.  The only strict requirement is to communicate clearly to
the list maintainer exactly how you want your issue to look.
</li>
<li><a name="submit_issue_G"></a>
It is not necessary for you to specify other html font/formatting
mark-up, but if you do the list maintainer will attempt to respect your
formatting wishes (as described by html markup, or other common idioms).
</li>
<li><a name="submit_issue_H"></a>
It is not necessary for you to specify open date or last modified date (the date
of your mail will be used).
</li>
<li><a name="submit_issue_I"></a>
It is not necessary for you to cross reference other issues, but you can if you
like.  You do not need to form the hyperlinks when you do, the list maintainer will
take care of that.
</li>
<li><a name="submit_issue_J"></a>
One issue per email is best.
</li>
<li><a name="submit_issue_K"></a>
Between the time you submit the issue, and the next mailing deadline
(date at the top of the Revision History), you <em>own</em> this issue. 
You control the content, the stuff that is right, the stuff that is
wrong, the format, the misspellings, etc.  You can even make the issue
disappear if you want.  Just let the list maintainer know how you want
it to look, and he will try his best to accommodate you.  After the
issue appears in an official mailing, you no longer enjoy exclusive
ownership of it.

<statuses>
  <p><b><a name="New">New</a></b> - The issue has not yet been
  reviewed by the EWG. Any <b>Wording available</b> is purely a
  suggestion from the issue submitter, and should not be construed as
  the view of EWG.</p>

  <p><b><a name="Open">Open</a></b> - The EWG has discussed the issue
  but is not yet ready to move the issue forward. There are several
  possible reasons for open status:</p>
     <ul>
        <li>Consensus may have not yet have been reached as to how to deal
            with the issue.</li>
        <li>Informal consensus may have been reached, but the EWG awaits
            exact resolution for review.</li>
        <li>The EWG wishes to consult additional technical experts before
            proceeding.</li>
        <li>The issue may require further study.</li>
     </ul>

  <p>A <b>Wording available</b> for an open issue is still not be
  construed as the view of EWG. Comments on the current state of
  discussions are often given at the end of open issues in an italic
  font. Such comments are for information only and should not be given
  undue importance.</p>

  <p><b><a name="Deferred">Deferred</a></b> - The EWG has discussed the issue,
  is not yet ready to move the issue forward, but neither does it deem the
  issue significant enough to delay publishing a standard or Technical Report.
  A typical deferred issue would be seeking to clarify wording that might be
  technically correct, but easily mis-read.</p>

  <p>A <b>Wording available</b> for a deferred issue is still not be
  construed as the view of EWG. Comments on the current state of
  discussions are often given at the end of open issues in an italic
  font. Such comments are for information only and should not be given
  undue importance.</p>

  <p><b><a name="Dup">Dup</a></b> - The EWG has reached consensus that
  the issue is a duplicate of another issue, and will not be further
  dealt with. A <b>Rationale</b> identifies the duplicated issue's
  issue number.  </p>

  <p><b><a name="NAD">NAD</a></b> - The EWG has reached consensus that
  the issue is not a defect in the Standard nor is it an extension
  the EWG deems acceptable.</p>

  <p><b><a name="Review">Review</a></b> - Exact resolution is now 
  available for review on an issue for which the EWG previously reached 
  informal consensus.</p>

  <p><b><a name="Ready">Ready</a></b> - The EWG has reached consensus
  that the issue is an extension that can go forward to Core, Library,
  or a Study Group for further processing.</p>

  <p><b><a name="Resolved">Resolved</a></b> - The EWG has reached consensus
  that the issue is a defect in or an acceptable extension to the Standard, 
  but the resolution adopted to
  resolve the issue came via some other mechanism than this issue in the
  list - typically by applying a formal paper, occasionally as a side effect
  of consolidating several interacting issue resolutions into a single issue.</p>

  <p><b><a name="DR">DR</a></b> - (Defect Report) - It's not expected
  that the EWG would handle Defect Reports.</p>

  <p><b><a name="WP">WP</a></b> - (Working Paper) - The proposed
  resolution has not been accepted as a Technical Corrigendum, but
  the full WG21/PL22.16 committee has voted to apply the issue's resolution
  to the working paper.</p>

  <p><b>Tentatively</b> - This is a <i>status qualifier</i>.  The issue has
  been reviewed online, or at an unofficial meeting, but not in an official meeting, and some support has been formed
  for the qualified status.  Tentatively qualified issues may be moved to the unqualified status
  and forwarded to full committee (if Ready) within the same meeting.  Unlike Ready issues, Tentatively Ready issues
  will be reviewed in subcommittee prior to forwarding to full committee.  When a status is
  qualified with Tentatively, the issue is still considered active.</p>

  <p><b>Pending</b> - This is a <i>status qualifier</i>.  When prepended to
  a status this indicates the issue has been
  processed by the committee, and a decision has been made to move the issue to
  the associated unqualified status.  However for logistical reasons the indicated
  outcome of the issue has not yet appeared in the latest working paper.

  <p>Issues are always given the status of <a href="ewg-active.html#New">New</a> when
  they first appear on the issues list. They may progress to
  <a href="ewg-active.html#Open">Open</a> or <a href="ewg-active.html#Review">Review</a> while the EWG
  is actively working on them. When the EWG has reached consensus on
  the disposition of an issue, the status will then change to
  <a href="ewg-active.html#Dup">Dup</a>, <a href="ewg-active.html#NAD">NAD</a>, or
  <a href="ewg-active.html#Ready">Ready</a> as appropriate.  Once the full J16 committee votes to
  forward Ready issues to the Project Editor, they are given the
  status of Defect Report ( <a href="ewg-active.html#DR">DR</a>). These in turn may
  become the basis for Technical Corrigenda (<a href="ewg-active.html#TC1">TC1</a>),
  or are closed without action other than a Record of Response
  (<a href="ewg-active.html#Resolved">Resolved</a> ). The intent of this EWG process is that
  issues which are defects in or accepted extensions to the Standard move to the
  formal ISO DR status.
