Discussed in Urbana. EWG favored being able to invoke non-members with
the member call syntax, and was undecided on the other aspects. Authors
are encouraged to follow up.

<p>
Discussed in Lenexa. EWG didn't reach consensus on the proposal. Straw
poll numbers were SF/WF/N/WA/SA 9/8/3/4/6. There is strong opposition
to the proposal with concerns about maintainability of code when
new free functions are added.
